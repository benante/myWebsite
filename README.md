# project_Website for Founders & Coders.

Simple website where I introduce myself and why I'd like to be a web developer.

JS. Three main functionalities:
- A function that changes the color of my name while scrolling on the page.
- A pop up preview for each project card.
- A visual "buzzing" effect of my profile pic, turning it into a pixelated version and then back again to the original.

CSS. First time using grid for the page layout and other divs.
